Use the following hardware components to make a room welcoming system:  
  - LED light strip
  - PIR sensor
  - Light sensor
  - USB speaker

Requirements:
The system block diagram and power block diagram for this device are shown at https://www.hackster.io/jchang5523/room-welcoming-system-fd27b1
Wire up the hardware accordingly.

Software Setup: The following commands and files should be properly installed/run before usage.
1. Speaker Setup After setting up the hardware, run the following commands:
▪ sudo apt-get update
▪ sudo apt-get install alsa-utils libasound2 –y
Check speaker is available
▪ aplay -l
Edit sound configuration file
▪ nano ~/.asoundrc
Add MP3 Capabilities:
▪ sudo apt-get install mplayer -y (may take a while)
▪ mplayer file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3

2. LED Strip Set-up
For the LED strip, first download and put the following files into a directory

    configure_pins.sh
    run
    run-opc-server
    opc-server
    opc.py
    config.json
    project.py

Note that configure_pins.sh, run, run-opc-server, opc-server must be given permissions 755. This can be done by running:
chmod 755 configure_pins.sh opc-server run run-opc-server
This can be checked by running command ls -l and checking to see if the files are highlighted green.
Also, the following PRU files must be in a subdirectory pru/bin/

    pru/bin/ws281x-original-ledscape-pru0.bin
    pru/bin/ws281x-original-ledscape-pru1.bin

We then must the following command to edit uENv.txt:
sudo nano /boot/uEnv.txt
Once the textbox appears, comment out the RPROC firmware and uncomment the UIO firmware.
Once that is complete run commands sudo reboot and ls /sys/class/uio to check that UIO is available.

Uses:

This project should welcome one home by playing a welcome sound and turn on LED lights on a ceiling whenever someone enters and turnthem off when and IR sensor is triggered. 
The LEDs should also automatically adjust their color based on the brightness of the room and a speaker should play a sound file.
